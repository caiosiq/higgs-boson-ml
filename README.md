# Higgs Boson Classification Using ML

This project uses real and simulated particle physics data to train a machine learning model that distinguishes Higgs boson events from background. It was developed as part of an MIT course project.
This is a simplified version of the full code to demonstrate the ideas, and all the data files are either removed or reduced. If you with to have access to the full code, email me.

## Goals
- Apply physics-inspired feature engineering and event selection ("cuts")
- Train a neural network to classify Higgs vs background
- Compare results with standard cut-based methods
- Improve signal significance using ML-based selection

## ðŸ“Š Results

The neural network was able to isolate Higgs-like events with improved signal significance compared to traditional cut-based methods. Below is an example of the classification output:
